## Phase 4 Requirements

In phase 4, we will be completing work on our Virtual Store by adding a two full page views to the application: Product Details and Checkout

The user stories from Phases 1, 2 and 3 remain unchanged. For this phase, we are now adding the following new user stories to meet the new requirements.

- As a user, I want to see a full detail view of a product so that I can make a more informed choice about purchasing it.

- As a user, I want to view my full cart and initiate the checkout process so that I can purchase my items and have them delivered
