## Phase 3 Requirements

In phase 3, we will be connecting our Virtual Store to a live API so that our data is persistent and able to be separately managed.

The user stories from Phases 1 and 2 remain unchanged. For this phase, we are now adding the following new user stories to meet the new requirements.

- As a user, I want to interact with live inventory so that I have confidence that the displayed products are in stock

- As a user, I want to know to that when I add an item to my cart, that it is removed from inventory so that no other users can purchase it
